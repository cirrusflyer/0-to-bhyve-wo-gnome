# Place this file in your vmroot/.templates (/zroot/bhyve/.templates 
# if you're following the Klarasystems 0-bhyve guide) in order to create
# new guests using the command vm create -t uefi guestname.

# If you want to pull a graphical console, you'll need the UEFI loader,
# no matter what OS you're installing on the guest.

# If not specified, cpu=n will give the guest n discrete CPU sockets.
# This is generally OK for Linux or BSD guests, but Windows throws a fit
# due to licensing issues, so we specify CPU topology manually here.

# put up to 8 disks on a single ahci controller.
# without this, adding a disk pushes the following network devices onto higher slot numbers,
# which causes windows to see them as a new interface

# e1000 works out-of-the-box, but virtio-net performs better. Built-in
# support on FreeBSD and Linux guests, but Windows guests will need
# to have virtio drivers manually installed.
